AutoSpeed for YouTube – Chrome Extension

Tired of changing playback speed every time you open a YouTube video?

🔹 Lightweight & fast — zero performance impact

🔹 No ads, no analytics, fully open-source

🔹 Simple settings page to change your default speed

🛠 How It Works

The extension listens for the YouTube player to load and applies your saved speed value using JavaScript, ensuring it works even when navigating within YouTube’s SPA pages.
